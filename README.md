# SYN Flood Script

This repository contains a Python script designed to demonstrate how a SYN flood attack works. The script generates multiple SYN requests to a specified target to simulate the effects of a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. **This is for educational purposes only.**

## 🛠 Features
- Generates SYN requests to a target IP and port.
- Demonstrates network behavior under a SYN flood attack.
- Allows user input for the target hostname and port.

## 🚀 Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Esammansour883/SYN-Flood-Script.git


Navigate to the script directory:

bash
Copy code
cd SYN-Flood-Script
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python SYN-Flood-Script.py
Enter the target hostname (e.g., rateglo.com) and port (e.g., 443 for HTTPS).

⚠️ Important Notes

80 for HTTP.
443 for HTTPS.
Ethical use only: Test only on networks or devices you own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized use is prohibited by law.
